1. Download vundle, for plugins management:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
2. Write a single line on your ~/.vimrc
```
echo "source ~/.vim/.vimrc" > ~/.vimrc
```
3. Inside `~/.vim`, download the .vimrc file
```
cd ~/.vim
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaobrittoneto/vimconfig/master/.vimrc
```

```
vim
:PluginInstall
```
